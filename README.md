# Capstone Project
## Project Title: Taxonomic Classification of DNA and RNA Viruses Using Machine Learning

### Project Description

Identification of viruses based on taxonomy classification can rely on GC content, DNA/protein sequence alignments, and the count of oligonucleotides or protein/peptides counts. Many viruses, including the COVID-19 SARS CoV virus, have undergone rapid mutation over a relatively short period. To address this issue, the goal of this project is to enhance viral taxonomy with unique sets of protein sequences that uniquely identify the concerned virus at the viral genus level. The aim is to select a total of 10 to 20 closely related viruses encompassing DNA and RNA viruses and utilize AI/ML tools to develop a differentiation method providing high-confidence viral differentiation on the viral genus level.

### Project Goals
- Utilize bioinformatics tools for DNA- and RNA-viruses to develop a method for virus identification through taxonomy classification/clustering.
- Identify the quality control mechanism in selected AI/ML bioinformatic tools for classification/clustering of the selected viruses. Provide insights into advantages or shortcomings compared to currently available methods.
- Compare the novel clustering approach to other virus taxonomy bioinformatics tools.
- Combine the findings and provide a pathway to improve the selected DNA- and RNA-viruses identification. Test the variants of emerging DNA and RNA viruses in the project.

### Project Scope
This project aims to develop an AI/ML-driven taxonomy classification tool for identifying viruses, particularly for assessing emerging viral strains. To ensure robust performance, we intend to train the tool on a dataset comprising a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 20 DNA and RNA viruses, enabling predictions at the viral genus level. Additionally, we will conduct a comparative analysis against established bioinformatics tools, identify quality control measures, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed approach.
